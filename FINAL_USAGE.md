When you ran the application and saw "silence" after the line "Testing S3 connection to http://localhost:9000...", it happened for several reasons:

1. **Network Issues**: The application couldn't connect to the S3 endpoint. Check:
   - Is your S3 service running?
   - Are the endpoint URL and port correct?
   - Do you have network connectivity to the S3 service?

2. **Authentication Problems**: The credentials might be incorrect. Check:
   - Are the access key and secret key correct?
   - Do the credentials have the necessary permissions?

3. **DNS Resolution**: The hostname might not be resolvable. Check:
   - Can you resolve the hostname with `nslookup` or `dig`?
   - Is there a typo in the URL?

## Solution

To fix these issues:

1. **Check your S3 service**:
   ```bash
   # If using MinIO
   mc admin info local
   
   # Or check if the service is listening
   netstat -tlnp | grep :9000
   ```

2. **Verify credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Test with AWS CLI
   aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 s3 ls
   ```

3. **Update your configuration**:
   ```yaml
   s3_urls:
     - "http://localhost:9000"  # Use HTTP, not HTTPS
   access_key: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
   secret_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
   bucket_name: "test-bucket"
   ```

## Example Configuration

Here's a complete example configuration:

```yaml
s3_urls:
  - http://localhost:9000        # S3 endpoint URLs
access_key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY     # Access key
secret_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY     # Secret key
bucket_name: test-bucket        # Bucket name
cluster_mode: false             # Cluster mode (multiple endpoints)
parallel_threads: 5             # Number of parallel threads
file_groups:
  small:
    max_size_mb: 100            # Max size for small files (MB)
    count: 100                  # Number of small files
  medium:
    max_size_mb: 5120           # Max size for medium files (MB)
    count: 50                   # Number of medium files
  large:
    max_size_mb: 20480          # Max size for large files (MB)
    count: 10                   # Number of large files
infinite_loop: true             # Run in infinite loop
cycle_delay_seconds: 15         # Delay between cycles (seconds)
```

## Testing the Connection

To test your configuration:

1. Run the connection test script:
   ```bash
   python test_s3_connection.py
   ```

2. Or run the application in configuration mode:
   ```bash
   python s3_flood.py --config
   ```

This will help you identify and fix connection issues before running the full test.
