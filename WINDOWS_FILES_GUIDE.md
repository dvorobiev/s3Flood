# Windows Files Guide - Final Clean Structure

## ✅ **ONLY 3 FILES NEEDED FOR WINDOWS**

**No confusion - only the essentials:**

### ⭐ **install.bat** - One-time setup (2.2KB)
**Purpose**: Windows installer script
- Checks for Python installation
- Installs PyYAML dependency
- Creates configuration files
- Downloads s5cmd binary automatically

**Usage**: Double-click once to install everything

### ⭐ **run_windows.bat** - Launcher (631 bytes)
**Purpose**: Windows launcher script  
- Sets up proper console encoding (UTF-8)
- Configures environment variables
- Launches the main Python program

**Usage**: Double-click every time you want to run the program

### ⭐ **s3_flood_windows.py** - Main program (23KB)
**Purpose**: Full S3 flood testing functionality
- **Complete original logic**: upload all → concurrent read/write batches → delete all
- Windows console compatibility
- Automatic s5cmd binary management
- Clean English interface (no encoding issues)
- Progress tracking and statistics

---

## 🚀 **Simple User Workflow:**

```
1. run install.bat          ← once
2. run run_windows.bat      ← every time you want to test
3. DONE! 🎉
```

## 🗑️ **Removed Files (No Longer Needed)**

These files were **deleted** to eliminate confusion:
- ~~run.ps1~~ - PowerShell launcher (redundant)
- ~~s3_flood_ultra_safe.py~~ - Duplicate functionality  
- ~~run.bat~~ - Generic launcher (redundant)
- ~~run_test*.py~~ - Test files not needed by users

---

## ⚙️ **Program Logic Flow:**

1. **File Creation** - Generates test files of various sizes
2. **Full Upload** - Uploads ALL files to S3
3. **Concurrent Operations** - Performs read/write operations in batches simultaneously
4. **Full Cleanup** - Deletes ALL files from S3
5. **Statistics** - Shows performance results

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### Issue: "Python not found"
**Solution**: Install Python from python.org, check "Add to PATH"

### Issue: "s5cmd not working"  
**Solution**: Program will download the correct version automatically

### Issue: Garbled text in console
**Solution**: Use run_windows.bat, it sets up proper encoding
